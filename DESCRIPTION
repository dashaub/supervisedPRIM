Description: The Patient Rules Induction Method (PRIM) is typically
used for "bump hunting" data mining to identify regions with abnormally
high concentrations of data with large or small values. This package
extends this methodology so that it can be applied to binomial classification
problems and used for prediction. While this method will not usually
create models with predictive accuracy comparable to more techniques such
as random forests or boosting, it is not highly correlated with the methodologies
used by other classification algorithms, so it can be useful in ensembles.
